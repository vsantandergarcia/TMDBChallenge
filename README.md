# TMDBChallenge

Create an app that interacts with the TMDB API (http://developers.themoviedb.org/).

- When the app is launched, a the listof the most popular movies is displayed.

- As soon as the user scrolls down and reaches the end of the list, the next page of
movies is loaded.

- The other functionality is the search: the user should have the possibility to search
for a movie by keyword. It is important that the search is automatically triggered, i.e. the search is automatically executed while typing the search term. When the user continues typing, the old search should be cancelled and a search for the new term must be started.

- The search results should be scrollable via pagination as well.

- Important properties to show in the search results are the movie title (title), the year
of release (year only), the overview (overview) without truncation and a picture.
